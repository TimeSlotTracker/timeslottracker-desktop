-- ===========================================================================

* Application should connect to data via sth like a DataInterface. 
  The interface layer is for isolating data layer from a view layer. 
  From a application point of view the only interesting is that 
  someone else know how to get data, how to save them, etc.

* Huge use of interfaces. This software will be evaluate in the future (I hope)
  so this should give a great opportunity to exchange some parts of application

* Application should be as simple as possible, with good usability

* Data should be saved in xml format. Application will make use of SAX Parser 
  (to read it on the start) and ? for saving it. Maybe for the begging we will
  manually construct the xml file.
  
* There should be a possibility to keep data in other formats as well.
  The Data interface should be so universal to make it useful to use a database,
  flat files or client/server approach.

* Data should be saved some every time (in example 5 minutes) and this autosave
  timeout should be configurable by a user.

* The xml file can grow up to some large size. To works fine the XML data class
  should make a transaction log - Vector of serialized objects representing 
  every change a user did. Then - every (for example) 1 hour whole xml file 
  is rewritten to be actual. This should save some time if needed (if xml file
  grew too much). The xml file should also be regenerated also when a user
  closes application.
  We need the transaction log of serialized objects when application crashes
  for some reason. Then, when a users starts timeslottracker again it should
  works in a such scenario:
  1. read existed xml file
  2. read our transaction log and apply every operation in order they appear
  3. regenerate the xml file
  4. continue the normal startup
  After every successfully regenerating the xml file transaction log should 
  be cleaned.

* Structure (described in dtd file) should be similar to:
  TASK 1
   +- TASK 1.1
       +- time slot 1.1.1
       +- time slot 1.1.2
   +- TASK 1.2
       +- description
  TASK 2
   +- description
   +- (*) category 2.*
   +- (*) time slot 2.*
   +- TASK 2.1
       +- description
       +- (*) time slot 2.1.*
           +- description
       +- (*) category 2.1.*
       +- TASK 2.1.1

  where: TASK (x) means our projects, sub-projects and tasks (any depth).
          It have one attribute - name
         time slot means a continuous time from attribute "start" to "finish". 
          It should also have an extra attribute "active".
         description means tree text describing that level (task or time slot) 
          - in the future it should be in html form
         category means zero, one or more free attributes from category's 
          dictionary (a user configurable one)
